"""
Verifies that the project virtual environment is complete and usable on this machine.

Checks two different things, because an import that succeeds is not proof that the
code will run: every dependency imports, AND the specific APIs and devices this project
uses are there in the installed versions. A pinned range in requirements.txt says what
we asked for; this says what we got.

**The same check does not weigh the same on every machine.** On the Jetson —the target,
detected by /etc/nv_tegra_release— the inference framework, the GPU, the model files
and what config.yaml turns on (GPIO, the RTSP codec) are requirements: without them the
app still starts, degraded, and catching that before the plant does is the point. On a
development PC they are notes: the mock model covers inference and the Linux-only
modules are expected to be absent.

**Machinery, with one block per fork.** The framework the fork's model runs on, and how
to probe its GPU, are in the block marked below. Everything else is generic and asks the
app instead of repeating it: the paths come from `system.paths`, the RTSP codec is
built by `rtsp_server.probe_codec()`, and what is enabled comes from config.yaml.

Run by venv-setup at the end of the install, and useful on its own as a diagnostic:

    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe setup\\venv-setup\\verify_env.py     # Windows
    .venv/bin/python setup/venv-setup/verify_env.py                 # Linux

Exits 1 when a requirement is unmet, 0 otherwise.
